# Extending-static-graphic-engine
I have to do it from scratch or look at books but I don't know where I put my old stuff. Now, you can seriously extend a graphic engine by adding textures relationships with reflection models for example. There must be other ways. Then, you can validate models but I don't know if it's best to use old models in physics.
